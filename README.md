Clone this project to your local machine.
### Prerequisites

[Spring Tool Suuuuuuuuuuuuite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) - Spring variant of Eclipse
Note: Of course, you can use your editor of choice i.e, IntelliJ, but you will have to manually setup a lot of stuffs and I won't cover that. Just use this one if you are lazy like me.

[Apache Tomcat 8.0.43](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) - Java Servlet


### Installing

Extract both Spring tool suite and Apache Tomcat to anywhere you wish.
Launch the suite and choose File>Open Project From File System..., navigate to this project and wait for Maven to update dependencies.
Try running the project and it should prompt you to use an existing server or define a new server.
Choose to define a new server and under Select the server type, look for Apache Tomcat 8.0.
Click Next. Then, one the next page click on Browse and navigate to the extracted Apache Tomcat 8.0.43.
